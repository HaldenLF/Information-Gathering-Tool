## Welcome to a Collection of Information Gathering programs
This collection of information-gathering functions was created in order to gather as much information as possible from a website. Once all the files and modules are imported to your computer you should be able to grab information like the IP address, DNS, and WHOIS info, along with a vulnerability check. Just run the main function, enter the site name, sit back, wait a few minutes, and you will have all this information. <br />
While not the most sophisticated collection of programs, this tool can save some time on information gathering.<br />
