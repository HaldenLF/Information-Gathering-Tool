## Versions
There are two versions of this project.<br />
**Version 1** is a group project from an internship, as a group we each took individual sections which were then combined together to produce the end output.<br />
**Version 2 _(WIP)_** is a self project that continues on from the group project but implements some changes to improve efficency and functionality. <br />
