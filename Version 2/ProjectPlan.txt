Goal:
    To create a tool that will be able to return informtation that is important to a penetration test.
    This tool can use other existing tools to accomplish this goal and will combine the results into a report.

What do I need to retrieve from a site?:
        Target Name & location
        IP address
        Domain name
        DNS records
        Open ports
        subdomains
        directories
        what software is running
        programming languages
        CMS
        frameworks    
        Versions of the above and possible vulns

    - MAYBES
        Gather information from social media platforms 
        (e.g., LinkedIn, Twitter) 
        to identify employees, their roles, and potential vulnerabilities.
